## Description:


In this first programming project assignment, we need to implement an analysis tool that can support the management team of a railway network to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical (e.g., trains). This tool, which will use a realistic data set, will allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected trains to lines, how to maximize its revenue when multiple levels of service are offered, or even, identify more sensitive sections of its network to failures so as to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.

## How it works:

First, you need to run the main.cpp file. When the file is correctly compiled and started, the main menu will appear. When the main menu appears, automatically, the information in the dataset will be read and saved in a directed graph.
In the main menu that will appear, 3 options will be available, which are designated the 3 main functions of the job, "Basic Service Metrics", "Operation Cost Optimization", "Reliability and Sensitivity to Line Failures".
All functions satisfying the above conditions are stored in the file "algorithm" . Each option has its designated function.
To use the program, just needs to use the intended as designated in the script.

## How to use:

### Runing the Program in CLion (Recommended):

-Open your C++ project in CLion;
-Ensure that your C++ file is open in the editor;
-Click on the green "Run" button in the toolbar, or select "Run" from the "Run" menu at the top of the window;
-If this is the first time you are running the project, you will need to set up a run configuration. Choose the appropriate target from the "Run/Debug Configuration" drop-down list and configure the settings as needed;
-Once the run configuration is set up, click on the green "Run" button again or select "Run" from the "Run" menu to run the code.
