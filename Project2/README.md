## Description:

The goal of this assignment is twofold. First, implement a basic exhaustive approach for the classic routing
problem using the TSP abstraction, therefore learning first hand that although such an approach can find
optimal solutions, its applicability is restricted to very small graphs. Second, refine your critical thinking
skills, by developing and analysing a set of approximate solutions to the TSP. You will work in groups of
2 or 3 students (3 is preferable) to encourage interpersonal and project management skills. The deliverables
for this project are both a description of an algorithm and its implementation alongside a short presentation

## How to use:

### Runing the Program in CLion (Recommended):

-Open your C++ project in CLion;
-Ensure that your C++ file is open in the editor;
-Click on the green "Run" button in the toolbar, or select "Run" from the "Run" menu at the top of the window;
-If this is the first time you are running the project, you will need to set up a run configuration. Choose the appropriate target from the "Run/Debug Configuration" drop-down list and configure the settings as needed;
-Once the run configuration is set up, click on the green "Run" button again or select "Run" from the "Run" menu to run the code.
